# The file format, without line comments, is the following:
# * The first line has the following info:
#
# <n> <m> <Nvalue?> <Ncap?> <Npos?> <Evalue?> <Ecap?> <N+values> <N+strings> <E+values> <E+strings>
#
# where:
# <n>        is the number of nodes in the graph
# <m>        can be -1 or the number of edges.
#            If it is -1, the graph is the euclidean graph and will not have
#            edge capacities or other aditional columns of type <E+.....> the edge
#            weights/values are the euclidean distance between point coordinates
# <Nvalue?>  can be 0 or 1. It indicates if there is a value/weight for a node.
# <Ncap?>    can be 0 or 1. It indicates if there is a value/weight for a node.
